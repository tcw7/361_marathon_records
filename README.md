# Marathon Records

Marathon Records is a python service that fetches the current marathon records for men and women. It writes the data into a text file, "marathon_records.py", after receiving a request.

## Usage

### Run the program:

```bash
python3 marathon_records.py
```

### Send a request:

write "run" into the file "marathon_records.txt", then save the file. Marathon Records will write new data into the same file.
